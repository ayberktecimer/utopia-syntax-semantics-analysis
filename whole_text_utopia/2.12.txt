‘Their women are not married before eighteen nor
their men before two-and-twenty, and if any of them run
into forbidden embraces before marriage they are severely
punished, and the privilege of marriage is denied them
unless they can obtain a special warrant from the Prince.
Such disorders cast a great reproach upon the master and
mistress of the family in which they happen, for it is
supposed that they have failed in their duty. The reason of
punishing this so severely is, because they think that if they
were not strictly restrained from all vagrant appetites, very
few would engage in a state in which they venture the
quiet of their whole lives, by being confined to one person, and are obliged to endure all the inconveniences
with which it is accompanied. In choosing their wives
they use a method that would appear to us very absurd
and ridiculous, but it is constantly observed among them,
and is accounted perfectly consistent with wisdom. Before
marriage some grave matron presents the bride, naked,
whether she is a virgin or a widow, to the bridegroom,
and after that some grave man presents the bridegroom,
naked, to the bride. We, indeed, both laughed at this, and
condemned it as very indecent. But they, on the other
hand, wondered at the folly of the men of all other
nations, who, if they are but to buy a horse of a small
value, are so cautious that they will see every part of him,
and take off both his saddle and all his other tackle, that
there may be no secret ulcer hid under any of them, and
that yet in the choice of a wife, on which depends the
happiness or unhappiness of the rest of his life, a man
should venture upon trust, and only see about a
handsbreadth of the face, all the rest of the body being
covered, under which may lie hid what may be contagious
as well as loathsome. All men are not so wise as to choose
a woman only for her good qualities, and even wise men
consider the body as that which adds not a little to the
mind, and it is certain there may be some such deformitycovered with clothes as may totally alienate a man from his
wife, when it is too late to part with her; if such a thing is
discovered after marriage a man has no remedy but
patience; they, therefore, think it is reasonable that there
should be good provision made against such mischievous
frauds.
‘There was so much the more reason for them to make
a regulation in this matter, because they are the only
people of those parts that neither allow of polygamy nor of
divorces, except in the case of adultery or insufferable
perverseness, for in these cases the Senate dissolves the
marriage and grants the injured person leave to marry
again; but the guilty are made infamous and are never
allowed the privilege of a second marriage. None are
suffered to put away their wives against their wills, from
any great calamity that may have fallen on their persons,
for they look on it as the height of cruelty and treachery to
abandon either of the married persons when they need
most the tender care of their consort, and that chiefly in
the case of old age, which, as it carries many diseases along
with it, so it is a disease of itself. But it frequently falls out
that when a married couple do not well agree, they, by
mutual consent, separate, and find out other persons with
whom they hope they may live more happily; yet this is not done without obtaining leave of the Senate, which
never admits of a divorce but upon a strict inquiry made,
both by the senators and their wives, into the grounds
upon which it is desired, and even when they are satisfied
concerning the reasons of it they go on but slowly, for
they imagine that too great easiness in granting leave for
new marriages would very much shake the kindness of
married people. They punish severely those that defile the
marriage bed; if both parties are married they are divorced,
and the injured persons may marry one another, or whom
they please, but the adulterer and the adulteress are
condemned to slavery, yet if either of the injured persons
cannot shake off the love of the married person they may
live with them still in that state, but they must follow
them to that labour to which the slaves are condemned,
and sometimes the repentance of the condemned, together
with the unshaken kindness of the innocent and injured
person, has prevailed so far with the Prince that he has
taken off the sentence; but those that relapse after they are
once pardoned are punished with death.
