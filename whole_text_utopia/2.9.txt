 They are unwearied pursuers of knowledge; for when we had given them some
hints of the learning and discipline of the Greeks,
concerning whom we only instructed them (for we know
that there was nothing among the Romans, except their
historians and their poets, that they would value much), it
was strange to see how eagerly they were set on learning
that language: we began to read a little of it to them,
rather in compliance with their importunity than out of
any hopes of their reaping from it any great advantage:
but, after a very short trial, we found they made such
progress, that we saw our labour was like to be more
successful than we could have expected: they learned to
write their characters and to pronounce their language so
exactly, had so quick an apprehension, they remembered it
so faithfully, and became so ready and correct in the use of
it, that it would have looked like a miracle if the greater
part of those whom we taught had not been men both of
extraordinary capacity and of a fit age for instruction: they
were, for the greatest part, chosen from among their
learned men by their chief council, though some studied it
of their own accord. In three years’ time they became
masters of the whole language, so that they read the best
of the Greek authors very exactly. I am, indeed, apt to
think that they learned that language the more easily from its having some relation to their own. I believe that they
were a colony of the Greeks; for though their language
comes nearer the Persian, yet they retain many names,
both for their towns and magistrates, that are of Greek
derivation. I happened to carry a great many books with
me, instead of merchandise, when I sailed my fourth
voyage; for I was so far from thinking of soon coming
back, that I rather thought never to have returned at all,
and I gave them all my books, among which were many
of Plato’s and some of Aristotle’s works: I had also
Theophrastus on Plants, which, to my great regret, was
imperfect; for having laid it carelessly by, while we were at
sea, a monkey had seized upon it, and in many places torn
out the leaves. They have no books of grammar but
Lascares, for I did not carry Theodorus with me; nor have
they any dictionaries but Hesichius and Dioscerides. They
esteem Plutarch highly, and were much taken with
Lucian’s wit and with his pleasant way of writing. As for
the poets, they have Aristophanes, Homer, Euripides, and
Sophocles of Aldus’s edition; and for historians,
Thucydides, Herodotus, and Herodian. One of my
companions, Thricius Apinatus, happened to carry with
him some of Hippocrates’s works and Galen’s
Microtechne, which they hold in great estimation; forthough there is no nation in the world that needs physic
so little as they do, yet there is not any that honours it so
much; they reckon the knowledge of it one of the
pleasantest and most profitable parts of philosophy, by
which, as they search into the secrets of nature, so they
not only find this study highly agreeable, but think that
such inquiries are very acceptable to the Author of nature;
and imagine, that as He, like the inventors of curious
engines amongst mankind, has exposed this great machine
of the universe to the view of the only creatures capable of
contemplating it, so an exact and curious observer, who
admires His workmanship, is much more acceptable to
Him than one of the herd, who, like a beast incapable of
reason, looks on this glorious scene with the eyes of a dull
and unconcerned spectator.
‘The minds of the Utopians, when fenced with a love
for learning, are very ingenious in discovering all such arts
as are necessary to carry it to perfection. Two things they
owe to us, the manufacture of paper and the art of
printing; yet they are not so entirely indebted to us for
these discoveries but that a great part of the invention was
their own. We showed them some books printed by
Aldus, we explained to them the way of making paper and
the mystery of printing; but, as we had never practised these arts, we described them in a crude and superficial
manner. They seized the hints we gave them; and though
at first they could not arrive at perfection, yet by making
many essays they at last found out and corrected all their
errors and conquered every difficulty. Before this they
only wrote on parchment, on reeds, or on the barks of
trees; but now they have established the manufactures of
paper and set up printing presses, so that, if they had but a
good number of Greek authors, they would be quickly
supplied with many copies of them: at present, though
they have no more than those I have mentioned, yet, by
several impressions, they have multiplied them into many
thousands. If any man was to go among them that had
some extraordinary talent, or that by much travelling had
observed the customs of many nations (which made us to
be so well received), he would receive a hearty welcome,
for they are very desirous to know the state of the whole
world. Very few go among them on the account of traffic;
for what can a man carry to them but iron, or gold, or
silver? which merchants desire rather to export than
import to a strange country: and as for their exportation,
they think it better to manage that themselves than to
leave it to foreigners, for by this means, as they understand
the state of the neighbouring countries better, so they keep up the art of navigation which cannot be maintained
but by much practice.
