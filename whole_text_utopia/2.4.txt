‘Agriculture is that which is so universally understood
among them that no person, either man or woman, is
ignorant of it; they are instructed in it from their
childhood, partly by what they learn at school, and partly
by practice, they being led out often into the fields about
the town, where they not only see others at work but are
likewise exercised in it themselves. Besides agriculture,
which is so common to them all, every man has some
peculiar trade to which he applies himself; such as the
manufacture of wool or flax, masonry, smith’s work, or
carpenter’s work; for there is no sort of trade that is in
great esteem among them. Throughout the island they
wear the same sort of clothes, without any other
distinction except what is necessary to distinguish the two
sexes and the married and unmarried. The fashion never
alters, and as it is neither disagreeable nor uneasy, so it is
suited to the climate, and calculated both for their
summers and winters. Every family makes their own
clothes; but all among them, women as well as men, learn
one or other of the trades formerly mentioned. Women,
for the most part, deal in wool and flax, which suit best
with their weakness, leaving the ruder trades to the men.
The same trade generally passes down from father to son,
inclinations often following descent: but if any man’s
genius lies another way he is, by adoption, translated into a
family that deals in the trade to which he is inclined; and
when that is to be done, care is taken, not only by his
father, but by the magistrate, that he may be put to a
discreet and good man: and if, after a person has learned
one trade, he desires to acquire another, that is also
allowed, and is managed in the same manner as the
former. When he has learned both, he follows that which
he likes best, unless the public has more occasion for the
other.
The chief, and almost the only, business of the
Syphogrants is to take care that no man may live idle, but
that every one may follow his trade diligently; yet they do
not wear themselves out with perpetual toil from morning
to night, as if they were beasts of burden, which as it is
indeed a heavy slavery, so it is everywhere the common
course of life amongst all mechanics except the Utopians:
but they, dividing the day and night into twenty-four
hours, appoint six of these for work, three of which are
before dinner and three after; they then sup, and at eight
o’clock, counting from noon, go to bed and sleep eight
hours: the rest of their time, besides that taken up in work,
eating, and sleeping, is left to every man’s discretion; yet
they are not to abuse that interval to luxury and idleness,
but must employ it in some proper exercise, according to
their various inclinations, which is, for the most part,
reading. It is ordinary to have public lectures every
morning before daybreak, at which none are obliged to
appear but those who are marked out for literature; yet a
great many, both men and women, of all ranks, go to hear
lectures of one sort or other, according to their
inclinations: but if others that are not made for
contemplation, choose rather to employ themselves at that
time in their trades, as many of them do, they are not
hindered, but are rather commended, as men that take
care to serve their country. After supper they spend an
hour in some diversion, in summer in their gardens, and in
winter in the halls where they eat, where they entertain
each other either with music or discourse. They do not so
much as know dice, or any such foolish and mischievous
games. They have, however, two sorts of games not unlike
our chess; the one is between several numbers, in which
one number, as it were, consumes another; the other
resembles a battle between the virtues and the vices, in
which the enmity in the vices among themselves, and their
agreement against virtue, is not unpleasantly represented;
together with the special opposition between the particular
virtues and vices; as also the methods by which vice either
openly assaults or secretly undermines virtue; and virtue,
on the other hand, resists it. But the time appointed for
labour is to be narrowly examined, otherwise you may
imagine that since there are only six hours appointed for
work, they may fall under a scarcity of necessary
provisions: but it is so far from being true that this time is
not sufficient for supplying them with plenty of all things,
either necessary or convenient, that it is rather too much;
and this you will easily apprehend if you consider how
great a part of all other nations is quite idle. First, women
generally do little, who are the half of mankind; and if
some few women are diligent, their husbands are idle:
then consider the great company of idle priests, and of
those that are called religious men; add to these all rich
men, chiefly those that have estates in land, who are called
noblemen and gentlemen, together with their families,
made up of idle persons, that are kept more for show than
use; add to these all those strong and lusty beggars that go
about pretending some disease in excuse for their begging;
and upon the whole account you will find that the
number of those by whose labours mankind is supplied is
much less than you perhaps imagined: then consider how
few of those that work are employed in labours that are of
real service, for we, who measure all things by money,
give rise to many trades that are both vain and superfluous,
and serve only to support riot and luxury: for if those who
work were employed only in such things as the
conveniences of life require, there would be such an
abundance of them that the prices of them would so sink
that tradesmen could not be maintained by their gains; if
all those who labour about useless things were set to more
profitable employments, and if all they that languish out
their lives in sloth and idleness (every one of whom
consumes as much as any two of the men that are at work)
were forced to labour, you may easily imagine that a small
proportion of time would serve for doing all that is either
necessary, profitable, or pleasant to mankind, especially
while pleasure is kept within its due bounds: this appears
very plainly in Utopia; for there, in a great city, and in all
the territory that lies round it, you can scarce find five
hundred, either men or women, by their age and strength
capable of labour, that are not engaged in it. Even the
Syphogrants, though excused by the law, yet do not
excuse themselves, but work, that by their examples they
may excite the industry of the rest of the people; the like
exemption is allowed to those who, being recommended
to the people by the priests, are, by the secret suffrages of
the Syphogrants, privileged from labour, that they may
apply themselves wholly to study; and if any of these fall
short of those hopes that they seemed at first to give, they
are obliged to return to work; and sometimes a mechanic
that so employs his leisure hours as to make a considerable
advancement in learning is eased from being a tradesman
and ranked among their learned men. Out of these they
choose their ambassadors, their priests, their Tranibors,
and the Prince himself, anciently called their Barzenes, but
is called of late their Ademus.
‘And thus from the great numbers among them that are
neither suffered to be idle nor to be employed in any
fruitless labour, you may easily make the estimate how
much may be done in those few hours in which they are
obliged to labour. But, besides all that has been already
said, it is to be considered that the needful arts among
them are managed with less labour than anywhere else.
The building or the repairing of houses among us employ
many hands, because often a thriftless heir suffers a house
that his father built to fall into decay, so that his successor
must, at a great cost, repair that which he might have kept
up with a small charge; it frequently happens that the same
house which one person built at a vast expense is
neglected by another, who thinks he has a more delicate
sense of the beauties of architecture, and he, suffering it to
fall to ruin, builds another at no less charge. But among
the Utopians all things are so regulated that men very
seldom build upon a new piece of ground, and are not
only very quick in repairing their houses, but show their
foresight in preventing their decay, so that their buildings
are preserved very long with but very little labour, and
thus the builders, to whom that care belongs, are often
without employment, except the hewing of timber and
the squaring of stones, that the materials may be in
readiness for raising a building very suddenly when there is
any occasion for it. As to their clothes, observe how little
work is spent in them; while they are at labour they are
clothed with leather and skins, cut carelessly about them,
which will last seven years, and when they appear in
public they put on an upper garment which hides the
other; and these are all of one colour, and that is the
natural colour of the wool. As they need less woollen
cloth than is used anywhere else, so that which they make
use of is much less costly; they use linen cloth more, but
that is prepared with less labour, and they value cloth only
by the whiteness of the linen or the cleanness of the wool,
without much regard to the fineness of the thread. While
in other places four or five upper garments of woollen
cloth of different colours, and as many vests of silk, will
scarce serve one man, and while those that are nicer think
ten too few, every man there is content with one, which
very often serves him two years; nor is there anything that
can tempt a man to desire more, for if he had them he
would neither be the, warmer nor would he make one jot
the better appearance for it. And thus, since they are all
employed in some useful labour, and since they content
themselves with fewer things, it falls out that there is a
great abundance of all things among them; so that it
frequently happens that, for want of other work, vast
numbers are sent out to mend the highways; but when no
public undertaking is to be performed, the hours of
working are lessened. The magistrates never engage the
people in unnecessary labour, since the chief end of the
constitution is to regulate labour by the necessities of the
public, and to allow the people as much time as is
necessary for the improvement of their minds, in which
they think the happiness of life consists.
