‘But it is now time to explain to you the mutual
intercourse of this people, their commerce, and the rules
by which all things are distributed among them.
‘As their cities are composed of families, so their
families are made up of those that are nearly related to one
another. Their women, when they grow up, are married
out, but all the males, both children and grandchildren,
live still in the same house, in great obedience to their
common parent, unless age has weakened his
understanding, and in that case he that is next to him in
age comes in his room; but lest any city should become
either too great, or by any accident be dispeopled,
provision is made that none of their cities may contain
above six thousand families, besides those of the country
around it. No family may have less than ten and more
than sixteen persons in it, but there can be no determined
number for the children under age; this rule is easily
observed by removing some of the children of a more
fruitful couple to any other family that does not abound so
much in them. By the same rule they supply cities that do
not increase so fast from others that breed faster; and if 
there is any increase over the whole island, then they draw
out a number of their citizens out of the several towns and
send them over to the neighbouring continent, where, if
they find that the inhabitants have more soil than they can
well cultivate, they fix a colony, taking the inhabitants
into their society if they are willing to live with them; and
where they do that of their own accord, they quickly
enter into their method of life and conform to their rules,
and this proves a happiness to both nations; for, according
to their constitution, such care is taken of the soil that it
becomes fruitful enough for both, though it might be
otherwise too narrow and barren for any one of them. But
if the natives refuse to conform themselves to their laws
they drive them out of those bounds which they mark out
for themselves, and use force if they resist, for they
account it a very just cause of war for a nation to hinder
others from possessing a part of that soil of which they
make no use, but which is suffered to lie idle and
uncultivated, since every man has, by the law of nature, a
right to such a waste portion of the earth as is necessary for
his subsistence. If an accident has so lessened the number
of the inhabitants of any of their towns that it cannot be
made up from the other towns of the island without
diminishing them too much (which is said to have fallen 
out but twice since they were first a people, when great
numbers were carried off by the plague), the loss is then
supplied by recalling as many as are wanted from their
colonies, for they will abandon these rather than suffer the
towns in the island to sink too low.
‘But to return to their manner of living in society: the
oldest man of every family, as has been already said, is its
governor; wives serve their husbands, and children their
parents, and always the younger serves the elder. Every
city is divided into four equal parts, and in the middle of
each there is a market-place. What is brought thither, and
manufactured by the several families, is carried from
thence to houses appointed for that purpose, in which all
things of a sort are laid by themselves; and thither every
father goes, and takes whatsoever he or his family stand in
need of, without either paying for it or leaving anything in
exchange. There is no reason for giving a denial to any
person, since there is such plenty of everything among
them; and there is no danger of a man’s asking for more
than he needs; they have no inducements to do this, since
they are sure they shall always be supplied: it is the fear of
want that makes any of the whole race of animals either
greedy or ravenous; but, besides fear, there is in man a
pride that makes him fancy it a particular glory to excel
others in pomp and excess; but by the laws of the
Utopians, there is no room for this. Near these markets
there are others for all sorts of provisions, where there are
not only herbs, fruits, and bread, but also fish, fowl, and
cattle. There are also, without their towns, places
appointed near some running water for killing their beasts
and for washing away their filth, which is done by their
slaves; for they suffer none of their citizens to kill their
cattle, because they think that pity and good-nature,
which are among the best of those affections that are born
with us, are much impaired by the butchering of animals;
nor do they suffer anything that is foul or unclean to be
brought within their towns, lest the air should be infected
by ill-smells, which might prejudice their health. In every
street there are great halls, that lie at an equal distance
from each other, distinguished by particular names. The
Syphogrants dwell in those that are set over thirty families,
fifteen lying on one side of it, and as many on the other.
In these halls they all meet and have their repasts; the
stewards of every one of them come to the market-place
at an appointed hour, and according to the number of
those that belong to the hall they carry home provisions.
But they take more care of their sick than of any others;
these are lodged and provided for in public hospitals. They
have belonging to every town four hospitals, that are built
without their walls, and are so large that they may pass for
little towns; by this means, if they had ever such a number
of sick persons, they could lodge them conveniently, and
at such a distance that such of them as are sick of infectious
diseases may be kept so far from the rest that there can be
no danger of contagion. The hospitals are furnished and
stored with all things that are convenient for the ease and
recovery of the sick; and those that are put in them are
looked after with such tender and watchful care, and are
so constantly attended by their skilful physicians, that as
none is sent to them against their will, so there is scarce
one in a whole town that, if he should fall ill, would not
choose rather to go thither than lie sick at home.
‘After the steward of the hospitals has taken for the sick
whatsoever the physician prescribes, then the best things
that are left in the market are distributed equally among
the halls in proportion to their numbers; only, in the first
place, they serve the Prince, the Chief Priest, the
Tranibors, the Ambassadors, and strangers, if there are any,
which, indeed, falls out but seldom, and for whom there
are houses, well furnished, particularly appointed for their
reception when they come among them. At the hours of
dinner and supper the whole Syphogranty being called 
together by sound of trumpet, they meet and eat together,
except only such as are in the hospitals or lie sick at home.
Yet, after the halls are served, no man is hindered to carry
provisions home from the marketplace, for they know that
none does that but for some good reason; for though any
that will may eat at home, yet none does it willingly, since
it is both ridiculous and foolish for any to give themselves
the trouble to make ready an ill dinner at home when
there is a much more plentiful one made ready for him so
near hand. All the uneasy and sordid services about these
halls are performed by their slaves; but the dressing and
cooking their meat, and the ordering their tables, belong
only to the women, all those of every family taking it by
turns. They sit at three or more tables, according to their
number; the men sit towards the wall, and the women sit
on the other side, that if any of them should be taken
suddenly ill, which is no uncommon case amongst women
with child, she may, without disturbing the rest, rise and
go to the nurses’ room (who are there with the sucking
children), where there is always clean water at hand and
cradles, in which they may lay the young children if there
is occasion for it, and a fire, that they may shift and dress
them before it. Every child is nursed by its own mother if
death or sickness does not intervene; and in that case the
Syphogrants’ wives find out a nurse quickly, which is no
hard matter, for any one that can do it offers herself
cheerfully; for as they are much inclined to that piece of
mercy, so the child whom they nurse considers the nurse
as its mother. All the children under five years old sit
among the nurses; the rest of the younger sort of both
sexes, till they are fit for marriage, either serve those that
sit at table, or, if they are not strong enough for that, stand
by them in great silence and eat what is given them; nor
have they any other formality of dining. In the middle of
the first table, which stands across the upper end of the
hall, sit the Syphogrant and his wife, for that is the chief
and most conspicuous place; next to him sit two of the
most ancient, for there go always four to a mess. If there is
a temple within the Syphogranty, the Priest and his wife
sit with the Syphogrant above all the rest; next them there
is a mixture of old and young, who are so placed that as
the young are set near others, so they are mixed with the
more ancient; which, they say, was appointed on this
account: that the gravity of the old people, and the
reverence that is due to them, might restrain the younger
from all indecent words and gestures. Dishes are not
served up to the whole table at first, but the best are first
set before the old, whose seats are distinguished from the
young, and, after them, all the rest are served alike. The
old men distribute to the younger any curious meats that
happen to be set before them, if there is not such an
abundance of them that the whole company may be
served alike.
‘Thus old men are honoured with a particular respect,
yet all the rest fare as well as they. Both dinner and supper
are begun with some lecture of morality that is read to
them; but it is so short that it is not tedious nor uneasy to
them to hear it. From hence the old men take occasion to
entertain those about them with some useful and pleasant
enlargements; but they do not engross the whole discourse
so to themselves during their meals that the younger may
not put in for a share; on the contrary, they engage them
to talk, that so they may, in that free way of conversation,
find out the force of every one’s spirit and observe his
temper. They despatch their dinners quickly, but sit long
at supper, because they go to work after the one, and are
to sleep after the other, during which they think the
stomach carries on the concoction more vigorously. They
never sup without music, and there is always fruit served
up after meat; while they are at table some burn perfumes
and sprinkle about fragrant ointments and sweet waters—
in short, they want nothing that may cheer up their spirits;
they give themselves a large allowance that way, and
indulge themselves in all such pleasures as are attended
with no inconvenience. Thus do those that are in the
towns live together; but in the country, where they live at
a great distance, every one eats at home, and no family
wants any necessary sort of provision, for it is from them
that provisions are sent unto those that live in the towns.
