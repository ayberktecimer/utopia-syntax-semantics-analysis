‘He that knows one of their towns knows them all—
they are so like one another, except where the situation
makes some difference. I shall therefore describe one of
them, and none is so proper as Amaurot; for as none is
more eminent (all the rest yielding in precedence to this,
because it is the seat of their supreme council), so there
was none of them better known to me, I having lived five
years all together in it.
‘It lies upon the side of a hill, or, rather, a rising
ground. Its figure is almost square, for from the one side of
it, which shoots up almost to the top of the hill, it runs
down, in a descent for two miles, to the river Anider; but
it is a little broader the other way that runs along by the
bank of that river. The Anider rises about eighty miles
above Amaurot, in a small spring at first. But other brooks
falling into it, of which two are more considerable than
the rest, as it runs by Amaurot it is grown half a mile
broad; but, it still grows larger and larger, till, after sixty
miles’ course below it, it is lost in the ocean. Between the
town and the sea, and for some miles above the town, it
ebbs and flows every six hours with a strong current. The
tide comes up about thirty miles so full that there is
nothing but salt water in the river, the fresh water being
driven back with its force; and above that, for some miles,
the water is brackish; but a little higher, as it runs by the
town, it is quite fresh; and when the tide ebbs, it continues
fresh all along to the sea. There is a bridge cast over the
river, not of timber, but of fair stone, consisting of many
stately arches; it lies at that part of the town which is
farthest from the sea, so that the ships, without any
hindrance, lie all along the side of the town. There is,
likewise, another river that runs by it, which, though it is
not great, yet it runs pleasantly, for it rises out of the same
hill on which the town stands, and so runs down through
it and falls into the Anider. The inhabitants have fortified
the fountain-head of this river, which springs a little
without the towns; that so, if they should happen to be
besieged, the enemy might not be able to stop or divert
the course of the water, nor poison it; from thence it is
carried, in earthen pipes, to the lower streets. And for
those places of the town to which the water of that small
river cannot be conveyed, they have great cisterns for
receiving the rain-water, which supplies the want of the
other. The town is compassed with a high and thick wall, 
in which there are many towers and forts; there is also a
broad and deep dry ditch, set thick with thorns, cast round
three sides of the town, and the river is instead of a ditch
on the fourth side. The streets are very convenient for all
carriage, and are well sheltered from the winds. Their
buildings are good, and are so uniform that a whole side of
a street looks like one house. The streets are twenty feet
broad; there lie gardens behind all their houses. These are
large, but enclosed with buildings, that on all hands face
the streets, so that every house has both a door to the
street and a back door to the garden. Their doors have all
two leaves, which, as they are easily opened, so they shut
of their own accord; and, there being no property among
them, every man may freely enter into any house
whatsoever. At every ten years’ end they shift their houses
by lots. They cultivate their gardens with great care, so
that they have both vines, fruits, herbs, and flowers in
them; and all is so well ordered and so finely kept that I
never saw gardens anywhere that were both so fruitful and
so beautiful as theirs. And this humour of ordering their
gardens so well is not only kept up by the pleasure they
find in it, but also by an emulation between the
inhabitants of the several streets, who vie with each other.
And there is, indeed, nothing belonging to the whole
town that is both more useful and more pleasant. So that
he who founded the town seems to have taken care of
nothing more than of their gardens; for they say the whole
scheme of the town was designed at first by Utopus, but
he left all that belonged to the ornament and improvement
of it to be added by those that should come after him, that
being too much for one man to bring to perfection. Their
records, that contain the history of their town and State,
are preserved with an exact care, and run backwards
seventeen hundred and sixty years. From these it appears
that their houses were at first low and mean, like cottages,
made of any sort of timber, and were built with mud walls
and thatched with straw. But now their houses are three
storeys high, the fronts of them are faced either with
stone, plastering, or brick, and between the facings of their
walls they throw in their rubbish. Their roofs are flat, and
on them they lay a sort of plaster, which costs very little,
and yet is so tempered that it is not apt to take fire, and yet
resists the weather more than lead. They have great
quantities of glass among them, with which they glaze
their windows; they use also in their windows a thin linen
cloth, that is so oiled or gummed that it both keeps out
the wind and gives free admission to the light.
