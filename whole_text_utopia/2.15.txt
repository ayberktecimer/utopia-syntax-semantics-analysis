They detest war as a very brutal thing, and which, to
the reproach of human nature, is more practised by men
than by any sort of beasts. They, in opposition to the
sentiments of almost all other nations, think that there is
nothing more inglorious than that glory that is gained by
war; and therefore, though they accustom themselves daily
to military exercises and the discipline of war, in which
not only their men, but their women likewise, are trained
up, that, in cases of necessity, they may not be quite
useless, yet they do not rashly engage in war, unless it be
either to defend themselves or their friends from any
unjust aggressors, or, out of good nature or in compassion,
assist an oppressed nation in shaking off the yoke of
tyranny. They, indeed, help their friends not only in
defensive but also in offensive wars; but they never do that
unless they had been consulted before the breach was
made, and, being satisfied with the grounds on which they
went, they had found that all demands of reparation were
rejected, so that a war was unavoidable. This they think to
be not only just when one neighbour makes an inroad on
another by public order, and carries away the spoils, but when the merchants of one country are oppressed in
another, either under pretence of some unjust laws, or by
the perverse wresting of good ones. This they count a
juster cause of war than the other, because those injuries
are done under some colour of laws. This was the only
ground of that war in which they engaged with the
Nephelogetes against the Aleopolitanes, a little before our
time; for the merchants of the former having, as they
thought, met with great injustice among the latter, which
(whether it was in itself right or wrong) drew on a terrible
war, in which many of their neighbours were engaged;
and their keenness in carrying it on being supported by
their strength in maintaining it, it not only shook some
very flourishing states and very much afflicted others, but,
after a series of much mischief ended in the entire
conquest and slavery of the Aleopolitanes, who, though
before the war they were in all respects much superior to
the Nephelogetes, were yet subdued; but, though the
Utopians had assisted them in the war, yet they pretended
to no share of the spoil
‘But, though they so vigorously assist their friends in
obtaining reparation for the injuries they have received in
affairs of this nature, yet, if any such frauds were
committed against themselves, provided no violence was done to their persons, they would only, on their being
refused satisfaction, forbear trading with such a people.
This is not because they consider their neighbours more
than their own citizens; but, since their neighbours trade
every one upon his own stock, fraud is a more sensible
injury to them than it is to the Utopians, among whom
the public, in such a case, only suffers, as they expect no
thing in return for the merchandise they export but that in
which they so much abound, and is of little use to them,
the loss does not much affect them. They think, therefore,
it would be too severe to revenge a loss attended with so
little inconvenience, either to their lives or their
subsistence, with the death of many persons; but if any of
their people are either killed or wounded wrongfully,
whether it be done by public authority, or only by private
men, as soon as they hear of it they send ambassadors, and
demand that the guilty persons may be delivered up to
them, and if that is denied, they declare war; but if it be
complied with, the offenders are condemned either to
death or slavery.
‘They would be both troubled and ashamed of a
bloody victory over their enemies; and think it would be
as foolish a purchase as to buy the most valuable goods at
too high a rate. And in no victory do they glory so much as in that which is gained by dexterity and good conduct
without bloodshed. In such cases they appoint public
triumphs, and erect trophies to the honour of those who
have succeeded; for then do they reckon that a man acts
suitably to his nature, when he conquers his enemy in
such a way as that no other creature but a man could be
capable of, and that is by the strength of his understanding.
Bears, lions, boars, wolves, and dogs, and all other animals,
employ their bodily force one against another, in which, as
many of them are superior to men, both in strength and
fierceness, so they are all subdued by his reason and
understanding.
‘The only design of the Utopians in war is to obtain
that by force which, if it had been granted them in time,
would have prevented the war; or, if that cannot be done,
to take so severe a revenge on those that have injured
them that they may be terrified from doing the like for the
time to come. By these ends they measure all their designs,
and manage them so, that it is visible that the appetite of
fame or vainglory does not work so much on there as a
just care of their own security.
‘As soon as they declare war, they take care to have a
great many schedules, that are sealed with their common
seal, affixed in the most conspicuous places of their enemies’ country. This is carried secretly, and done in
many places all at once. In these they promise great
rewards to such as shall kill the prince, and lesser in
proportion to such as shall kill any other persons who are
those on whom, next to the prince himself, they cast the
chief balance of the war. And they double the sum to him
that, instead of killing the person so marked out, shall take
him alive, and put him in their hands. They offer not only
indemnity, but rewards, to such of the persons themselves
that are so marked, if they will act against their
countrymen. By this means those that are named in their
schedules become not only distrustful of their fellowcitizens,
but are jealous of one another, and are much
distracted by fear and danger; for it has often fallen out
that many of them, and even the prince himself, have been
betrayed, by those in whom they have trusted most; for
the rewards that the Utopians offer are so immeasurably
great, that there is no sort of crime to which men cannot
be drawn by them. They consider the risk that those run
who undertake such services, and offer a recompense
proportioned to the danger—not only a vast deal of gold,
but great revenues in lands, that lie among other nations
that are their friends, where they may go and enjoy them
very securely; and they observe the promises they make of their kind most religiously. They very much approve of
this way of corrupting their enemies, though it appears to
others to be base and cruel; but they look on it as a wise
course, to make an end of what would be otherwise a long
war, without so much as hazarding one battle to decide it.
They think it likewise an act of mercy and love to
mankind to prevent the great slaughter of those that must
otherwise be killed in the progress of the war, both on
their own side and on that of their enemies, by the death
of a few that are most guilty; and that in so doing they are
kind even to their enemies, and pity them no less than
their own people, as knowing that the greater part of them
do not engage in the war of their own accord, but are
driven into it by the passions of their prince.
‘If this method does not succeed with them, then they
sow seeds of contention among their enemies, and animate
the prince’s brother, or some of the nobility, to aspire to
the crown. If they cannot disunite them by domestic
broils, then they engage their neighbours against them,
and make them set on foot some old pretensions, which
are never wanting to princes when they have occasion for
them. These they plentifully supply with money, though
but very sparingly with any auxiliary troops; for they are
so tender of their own people that they would not willingly exchange one of them, even with the prince of
their enemies’ country.
‘But as they keep their gold and silver only for such an
occasion, so, when that offers itself, they easily part with it;
since it would be no convenience to them, though they
should reserve nothing of it to themselves. For besides the
wealth that they have among them at home, they have a
vast treasure abroad; many nations round about them
being deep in their debt: so that they hire soldiers from all
places for carrying on their wars; but chiefly from the
Zapolets, who live five hundred miles east of Utopia.
They are a rude, wild, and fierce nation, who delight in
the woods and rocks, among which they were born and
bred up. They are hardened both against heat, cold, and
labour, and know nothing of the delicacies of life. They
do not apply themselves to agriculture, nor do they care
either for their houses or their clothes: cattle is all that they
look after; and for the greatest part they live either by
hunting or upon rapine; and are made, as it were, only for
war. They watch all opportunities of engaging in it, and
very readily embrace such as are offered them. Great
numbers of them will frequently go out, and offer
themselves for a very low pay, to serve any that will
employ them: they know none of the arts of life, but those that lead to the taking it away; they serve those that hire
them, both with much courage and great fidelity; but will
not engage to serve for any determined time, and agree
upon such terms, that the next day they may go over to
the enemies of those whom they serve if they offer them a
greater encouragement; and will, perhaps, return to them
the day after that upon a higher advance of their pay.
There are few wars in which they make not a considerable
part of the armies of both sides: so it often falls out that
they who are related, and were hired in the same country,
and so have lived long and familiarly together, forgetting
both their relations and former friendship, kill one another
upon no other consideration than that of being hired to it
for a little money by princes of different interests; and such
a regard have they for money that they are easily wrought
on by the difference of one penny a day to change sides.
So entirely does their avarice influence them; and yet this
money, which they value so highly, is of little use to them;
for what they purchase thus with their blood they quickly
waste on luxury, which among them is but of a poor and
miserable form.
‘This nation serves the Utopians against all people
whatsoever, for they pay higher than any other. The
Utopians hold this for a maxim, that as they seek out thebest sort of men for their own use at home, so they make
use of this worst sort of men for the consumption of war;
and therefore they hire them with the offers of vast
rewards to expose themselves to all sorts of hazards, out of
which the greater part never returns to claim their
promises; yet they make them good most religiously to
such as escape. This animates them to adventure again,
whenever there is occasion for it; for the Utopians are not
at all troubled how many of these happen to be killed, and
reckon it a service done to mankind if they could be a
means to deliver the world from such a lewd and vicious
sort of people, that seem to have run together, as to the
drain of human nature. Next to these, they are served in
their wars with those upon whose account they undertake
them, and with the auxiliary troops of their other friends,
to whom they join a few of their own people, and send
some man of eminent and approved virtue to command in
chief. There are two sent with him, who, during his
command, are but private men, but the first is to succeed
him if he should happen to be either killed or taken; and,
in case of the like misfortune to him, the third comes in
his place; and thus they provide against all events, that
such accidents as may befall their generals may not
endanger their armies. When they draw out troops of their own people, they take such out of every city as freely offer
themselves, for none are forced to go against their wills,
since they think that if any man is pressed that wants
courage, he will not only act faintly, but by his cowardice
dishearten others. But if an invasion is made on their
country, they make use of such men, if they have good
bodies, though they are not brave; and either put them
aboard their ships, or place them on the walls of their
towns, that being so posted, they may find no opportunity
of flying away; and thus either shame, the heat of action,
or the impossibility of flying, bears down their cowardice;
they often make a virtue of necessity, and behave
themselves well, because nothing else is left them. But as
they force no man to go into any foreign war against his
will, so they do not hinder those women who are willing
to go along with their husbands; on the contrary, they
encourage and praise them, and they stand often next their
husbands in the front of the army. They also place
together those who are related, parents, and children,
kindred, and those that are mutually allied, near one
another; that those whom nature has inspired with the
greatest zeal for assisting one another may be the nearest
and readiest to do it; and it is matter of great reproach if
husband or wife survive one another, or if a child survives his parent, and therefore when they come to be engaged
in action, they continue to fight to the last man, if their
enemies stand before them: and as they use all prudent
methods to avoid the endangering their own men, and if it
is possible let all the action and danger fall upon the troops
that they hire, so if it becomes necessary for themselves to
engage, they then charge with as much courage as they
avoided it before with prudence: nor is it a fierce charge at
first, but it increases by degrees; and as they continue in
action, they grow more obstinate, and press harder upon
the enemy, insomuch that they will much sooner die than
give ground; for the certainty that their children will be
well looked after when they are dead frees them from all
that anxiety concerning them which often masters men of
great courage; and thus they are animated by a noble and
invincible resolution. Their skill in military affairs increases
their courage: and the wise sentiments which, according to
the laws of their country, are instilled into them in their
education, give additional vigour to their minds: for as
they do not undervalue life so as prodigally to throw it
away, they are not so indecently fond of it as to preserve it
by base and unbecoming methods. In the greatest heat of
action the bravest of their youth, who have devoted
themselves to that service, single out the general of their enemies, set on him either openly or by ambuscade;
pursue him everywhere, and when spent and wearied out,
are relieved by others, who never give over the pursuit,
either attacking him with close weapons when they can
get near him, or with those which wound at a distance,
when others get in between them. So that, unless he
secures himself by flight, they seldom fail at last to kill or
to take him prisoner. When they have obtained a victory,
they kill as few as possible, and are much more bent on
taking many prisoners than on killing those that fly before
them. Nor do they ever let their men so loose in the
pursuit of their enemies as not to retain an entire body still
in order; so that if they have been forced to engage the last
of their battalions before they could gain the day, they will
rather let their enemies all escape than pursue them when
their own army is in disorder; remembering well what has
often fallen out to themselves, that when the main body of
their army has been quite defeated and broken, when their
enemies, imagining the victory obtained, have let
themselves loose into an irregular pursuit, a few of them
that lay for a reserve, waiting a fit opportunity, have fallen
on them in their chase, and when straggling in disorder,
and apprehensive of no danger, but counting the day their
own, have turned the whole action, and, wresting out oftheir hands a victory that seemed certain and undoubted,
while the vanquished have suddenly become victorious.
‘It is hard to tell whether they are more dexterous in
laying or avoiding ambushes. They sometimes seem to fly
when it is far from their thoughts; and when they intend
to give ground, they do it so that it is very hard to find out
their design. If they see they are ill posted, or are like to be
overpowered by numbers, they then either march off in
the night with great silence, or by some stratagem delude
their enemies. If they retire in the day-time, they do it in
such order that it is no less dangerous to fall upon them in
a retreat than in a march. They fortify their camps with a
deep and large trench; and throw up the earth that is dug
out of it for a wall; nor do they employ only their slaves in
this, but the whole army works at it, except those that are
then upon the guard; so that when so many hands are at
work, a great line and a strong fortification is finished in so
short a time that it is scarce credible. Their armour is very
strong for defence, and yet is not so heavy as to make
them uneasy in their marches; they can even swim with it.
All that are trained up to war practise swimming. Both
horse and foot make great use of arrows, and are very
expert. They have no swords, but fight with a pole-axe
that is both sharp and heavy, by which they thrust or strike down an enemy. They are very good at finding out
warlike machines, and disguise them so well that the
enemy does not perceive them till he feels the use of
them; so that he cannot prepare such a defence as would
render them useless; the chief consideration had in the
making them is that they may be easily carried and
managed.
‘If they agree to a truce, they observe it so religiously
that no provocations will make them break it. They never
lay their enemies’ country waste nor burn their corn, and
even in their marches they take all possible care that
neither horse nor foot may tread it down, for they do not
know but that they may have use for it themselves. They
hurt no man whom they find disarmed, unless he is a spy.
When a town is surrendered to them, they take it into
their protection; and when they carry a place by storm
they never plunder it, but put those only to the sword that
oppose the rendering of it up, and make the rest of the
garrison slaves, but for the other inhabitants, they do them
no hurt; and if any of them had advised a surrender, they
give them good rewards out of the estates of those that
they condemn, and distribute the rest among their
auxiliary troops, but they themselves take no share of the
spoil. ‘When a war is ended, they do not oblige their friends
to reimburse their expenses; but they obtain them of the
conquered, either in money, which they keep for the next
occasion, or in lands, out of which a constant revenue is to
be paid them; by many increases the revenue which they
draw out from several countries on such occasions is now
risen to above 700,000 ducats a year. They send some of
their own people to receive these revenues, who have
orders to live magnificently and like princes, by which
means they consume much of it upon the place; and either
bring over the rest to Utopia or lend it to that nation in
which it lies. This they most commonly do, unless some
great occasion, which falls out but very seldom, should
oblige them to call for it all. It is out of these lands that
they assign rewards to such as they encourage to adventure
on desperate attempts. If any prince that engages in war
with them is making preparations for invading their
country, they prevent him, and make his country the seat
of the war; for they do not willingly suffer any war to
break in upon their island; and if that should happen, they
would only defend themselves by their own people; but
would not call for auxiliary troops to their assistance.
