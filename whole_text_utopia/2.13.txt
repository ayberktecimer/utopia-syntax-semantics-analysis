‘Their law does not determine the punishment for
other crimes, but that is left to the Senate, to temper it
according to the circumstances of the fact. Husbands have
power to correct their wives and parents to chastise their children, unless the fault is so great that a public
punishment is thought necessary for striking terror into
others. For the most part slavery is the punishment even of
the greatest crimes, for as that is no less terrible to the
criminals themselves than death, so they think the
preserving them in a state of servitude is more for the
interest of the commonwealth than killing them, since, as
their labour is a greater benefit to the public than their
death could be, so the sight of their misery is a more
lasting terror to other men than that which would be
given by their death. If their slaves rebel, and will not bear
their yoke and submit to the labour that is enjoined them,
they are treated as wild beasts that cannot be kept in order,
neither by a prison nor by their chains, and are at last put
to death. But those who bear their punishment patiently,
and are so much wrought on by that pressure that lies so
hard on them, that it appears they are really more troubled
for the crimes they have committed than for the miseries
they suffer, are not out of hope, but that, at last, either the
Prince will, by his prerogative, or the people, by their
intercession, restore them again to their liberty, or, at least,
very much mitigate their slavery. He that tempts a married
woman to adultery is no less severely punished than he
that commits it, for they believe that a deliberate design tocommit a crime is equal to the fact itself, since its not
taking effect does not make the person that miscarried in
his attempt at all the less guilty.
‘They take great pleasure in fools, and as it is thought a
base and unbecoming thing to use them ill, so they do not
think it amiss for people to divert themselves with their
folly; and, in their opinion, this is a great advantage to the
fools themselves; for if men were so sullen and severe as
not at all to please themselves with their ridiculous
behaviour and foolish sayings, which is all that they can do
to recommend themselves to others, it could not be
expected that they would be so well provided for nor so
tenderly used as they must otherwise be. If any man
should reproach another for his being misshaped or
imperfect in any part of his body, it would not at all be
thought a reflection on the person so treated, but it would
be accounted scandalous in him that had upbraided
another with what he could not help. It is thought a sign
of a sluggish and sordid mind not to preserve carefully
one’s natural beauty; but it is likewise infamous among
them to use paint. They all see that no beauty
recommends a wife so much to her husband as the probity
of her life and her obedience; for as some few are caught and held only by beauty, so all are attracted by the other
excellences which charm all the world.
‘As they fright men from committing crimes by
punishments, so they invite them to the love of virtue by
public honours; therefore they erect statues to the
memories of such worthy men as have deserved well of
their country, and set these in their market-places, both to
perpetuate the remembrance of their actions and to be an
incitement to their posterity to follow their example.
‘If any man aspires to any office he is sure never to
compass it. They all live easily together, for none of the
magistrates are either insolent or cruel to the people; they
affect rather to be called fathers, and, by being really so,
they well deserve the name; and the people pay them all
the marks of honour the more freely because none are
exacted from them. The Prince himself has no distinction,
either of garments or of a crown; but is only distinguished
by a sheaf of corn carried before him; as the High Priest is
also known by his being preceded by a person carrying a
wax light.
‘They have but few laws, and such is their constitution
that they need not many. They very much condemn other
nations whose laws, together with the commentaries on
them, swell up to so many volumes; for they think it an unreasonable thing to oblige men to obey a body of laws
that are both of such a bulk, and so dark as not to be read
and understood by every one of the subjects.
‘They have no lawyers among them, for they consider
them as a sort of people whose profession it is to disguise
matters and to wrest the laws, and, therefore, they think it
is much better that every man should plead his own cause,
and trust it to the judge, as in other places the client trusts
it to a counsellor; by this means they both cut off many
delays and find out truth more certainly; for after the
parties have laid open the merits of the cause, without
those artifices which lawyers are apt to suggest, the judge
examines the whole matter, and supports the simplicity of
such well-meaning persons, whom otherwise crafty men
would be sure to run down; and thus they avoid those
evils which appear very remarkably among all those
nations that labour under a vast load of laws. Every one of
them is skilled in their law; for, as it is a very short study,
so the plainest meaning of which words are capable is
always the sense of their laws; and they argue thus: all laws
are promulgated for this end, that every man may know
his duty; and, therefore, the plainest and most obvious
sense of the words is that which ought to be put upon
them, since a more refined exposition cannot be easily comprehended, and would only serve to make the laws
become useless to the greater part of mankind, and
especially to those who need most the direction of them;
for it is all one not to make a law at all or to couch it in
such terms that, without a quick apprehension and much
study, a man cannot find out the true meaning of it, since
the generality of mankind are both so dull, and so much
employed in their several trades, that they have neither the
leisure nor the capacity requisite for such an inquiry.
