‘They do not make slaves of prisoners of war, except
those that are taken in battle, nor of the sons of their
slaves, nor of those of other nations: the slaves among
them are only such as are condemned to that state of life
for the commission of some crime, or, which is more
common, such as their merchants find condemned to die
in those parts to which they trade, whom they sometimes
redeem at low rates, and in other places have them for
nothing. They are kept at perpetual labour, and are always
chained, but with this difference, that their own natives
are treated much worse than others: they are considered as
more profligate than the rest, and since they could not be
restrained by the advantages of so excellent an education,
are judged worthy of harder usage. Another sort of slaves
are the poor of the neighbouring countries, who offer of
their own accord to come and serve them: they treat these
better, and use them in all other respects as well as their
own countrymen, except their imposing more labour
upon them, which is no hard task to those that have been
accustomed to it; and if any of these have a mind to go back to their own country, which, indeed, falls out but
seldom, as they do not force them to stay, so they do not
send them away empty-handed.
