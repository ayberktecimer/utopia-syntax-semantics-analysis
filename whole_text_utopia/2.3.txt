‘Thirty families choose every year a magistrate, who
was anciently called the Syphogrant, but is now called the
Philarch; and over every ten Syphogrants, with the
families subject to them, there is another magistrate, who
was anciently called the Tranibore, but of late the
Archphilarch. All the Syphogrants, who are in number
two hundred, choose the Prince out of a list of four who
are named by the people of the four divisions of the city;
but they take an oath, before they proceed to an election,
that they will choose him whom they think most fit for
the office: they give him their voices secretly, so that it is
not known for whom every one gives his suffrage. The
Prince is for life, unless he is removed upon suspicion of
some design to enslave the people. The Tranibors are new
chosen every year, but yet they are, for the most part,
continued; all their other magistrates are only annual. The
Tranibors meet every third day, and oftener if necessary,
and consult with the Prince either concerning the affairs of
the State in general, or such private differences as may
arise sometimes among the people, though that falls out
but seldom. There are always two Syphogrants called into
the council chamber, and these are changed every day. It
is a fundamental rule of their government, that no
conclusion can be made in anything that relates to the
public till it has been first debated three several days in
their council. It is death for any to meet and consult
concerning the State, unless it be either in their ordinary
council, or in the assembly of the whole body of the
people.
‘These things have been so provided among them that
the Prince and the Tranibors may not conspire together to
change the government and enslave the people; and
therefore when anything of great importance is set on
foot, it is sent to the Syphogrants, who, after they have
communicated it to the families that belong to their
divisions, and have considered it among themselves, make
report to the senate; and, upon great occasions, the matter
is referred to the council of the whole island. One rule
observed in their council is, never to debate a thing on the
same day in which it is first proposed; for that is always
referred to the next meeting, that so men may not rashly
and in the heat of discourse engage themselves too soon,
which might bias them so much that, instead of consulting
the good of the public, they might rather study to support
their first opinions, and by a perverse and preposterous sort
of shame hazard their country rather than endanger their
own reputation, or venture the being suspected to have
wanted foresight in the expedients that they at first
proposed; and therefore, to prevent this, they take care
that they may rather be deliberate than sudden in their
motions.
