‘I have already told you with what care they look after
their sick, so that nothing is left undone that can
contribute either to their case or health; and for those who
are taken with fixed and incurable diseases, they use all
possible ways to cherish them and to make their lives as
comfortable as possible. They visit them often and take
great pains to make their time pass off easily; but when any
is taken with a torturing and lingering pain, so that there is
no hope either of recovery or ease, the priests and
magistrates come and exhort them, that, since they are
now unable to go on with the business of life, are become
a burden to themselves and to all about them, and they
have really out-lived themselves, they should no longer
nourish such a rooted distemper, but choose rather to die
since they cannot live but in much misery; being assured
that if they thus deliver themselves from torture, or are
willing that others should do it, they shall be happy after
death: since, by their acting thus, they lose none of the
pleasures, but only the troubles of life, they think they
behave not only reasonably but in a manner consistent
with religion and piety; because they follow the advice given them by their priests, who are the expounders of the
will of God. Such as are wrought on by these persuasions
either starve themselves of their own accord, or take
opium, and by that means die without pain. But no man is
forced on this way of ending his life; and if they cannot be
persuaded to it, this does not induce them to fail in their
attendance and care of them: but as they believe that a
voluntary death, when it is chosen upon such an authority,
is very honourable, so if any man takes away his own life
without the approbation of the priests and the senate, they
give him none of the honours of a decent funeral, but
throw his body into a ditch.
