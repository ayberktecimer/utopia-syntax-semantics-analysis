 When they have thus taken care
of their whole country, and laid up stores for two years
(which they do to prevent the ill consequences of an
unfavourable season), they order an exportation of the
overplus, both of corn, honey, wool, flax, wood, wax,
tallow, leather, and cattle, which they send out,
commonly in great quantities, to other nations. They
order a seventh part of all these goods to be freely given to
the poor of the countries to which they send them, and
sell the rest at moderate rates; and by this exchange they
not only bring back those few things that they need at
home (for, indeed, they scarce need anything but iron),
but likewise a great deal of gold and silver; and by their
driving this trade so long, it is not to be imagined how
vast a treasure they have got among them, so that now
they do not much care whether they sell off their
merchandise for money in hand or upon trust. A great part
of their treasure is now in bonds; but in all their contracts
no private man stands bound, but the writing runs in the
name of the town; and the towns that owe them money
raise it from those private hands that owe it to them, lay it
up in their public chamber, or enjoy the profit of it till the Utopians call for it; and they choose rather to let the
greatest part of it lie in their hands, who make advantage
by it, than to call for it themselves; but if they see that any
of their other neighbours stand more in need of it, then
they call it in and lend it to them. Whenever they are
engaged in war, which is the only occasion in which their
treasure can be usefully employed, they make use of it
themselves; in great extremities or sudden accidents they
employ it in hiring foreign troops, whom they more
willingly expose to danger than their own people; they
give them great pay, knowing well that this will work
even on their enemies; that it will engage them either to
betray their own side, or, at least, to desert it; and that it is
the best means of raising mutual jealousies among them.
For this end they have an incredible treasure; but they do
not keep it as a treasure, but in such a manner as I am
almost afraid to tell, lest you think it so extravagant as to
be hardly credible. This I have the more reason to
apprehend because, if I had not seen it myself, I could not
have been easily persuaded to have believed it upon any
man’s report.
‘It is certain that all things appear incredible to us in
proportion as they differ from known customs; but one
who can judge aright will not wonder to find that, since their constitution differs so much from ours, their value of
gold and silver should be measured by a very different
standard; for since they have no use for money among
themselves, but keep it as a provision against events which
seldom happen, and between which there are generally
long intervening intervals, they value it no farther than it
deserves—that is, in proportion to its use. So that it is
plain they must prefer iron either to gold or silver, for
men can no more live without iron than without fire or
water; but Nature has marked out no use for the other
metals so essential as not easily to be dispensed with. The
folly of men has enhanced the value of gold and silver
because of their scarcity; whereas, on the contrary, it is
their opinion that Nature, as an indulgent parent, has
freely given us all the best things in great abundance, such
as water and earth, but has laid up and hid from us the
things that are vain and useless.
‘If these metals were laid up in any tower in the
kingdom it would raise a jealousy of the Prince and
Senate, and give birth to that foolish mistrust into which
the people are apt to fall—a jealousy of their intending to
sacrifice the interest of the public to their own private
advantage. If they should work it into vessels, or any sort
of plate, they fear that the people might grow too fond ofit, and so be unwilling to let the plate be run down, if a
war made it necessary, to employ it in paying their
soldiers. To prevent all these inconveniences they have
fallen upon an expedient which, as it agrees with their
other policy, so is it very different from ours, and will
scarce gain belief among us who value gold so much, and
lay it up so carefully. They eat and drink out of vessels of
earth or glass, which make an agreeable appearance,
though formed of brittle materials; while they make their
chamber-pots and close- stools of gold and silver, and that
not only in their public halls but in their private houses.
Of the same metals they likewise make chains and fetters
for their slaves, to some of which, as a badge of infamy,
they hang an earring of gold, and make others wear a
chain or a coronet of the same metal; and thus they take
care by all possible means to render gold and silver of no
esteem; and from hence it is that while other nations part
with their gold and silver as unwillingly as if one tore out
their bowels, those of Utopia would look on their giving
in all they possess of those metals (when there were any
use for them) but as the parting with a trifle, or as we
would esteem the loss of a penny! They find pearls on
their coasts, and diamonds and carbuncles on their rocks;
they do not look after them, but, if they find them by chance, they polish them, and with them they adorn their
children, who are delighted with them, and glory in them
during their childhood; but when they grow to years, and
see that none but children use such baubles, they of their
own accord, without being bid by their parents, lay them
aside, and would be as much ashamed to use them
afterwards as children among us, when they come to years,
are of their puppets and other toys.
‘I never saw a clearer instance of the opposite
impressions that different customs make on people than I
observed in the ambassadors of the Anemolians, who came
to Amaurot when I was there. As they came to treat of
affairs of great consequence, the deputies from several
towns met together to wait for their coming. The
ambassadors of the nations that lie near Utopia, knowing
their customs, and that fine clothes are in no esteem
among them, that silk is despised, and gold is a badge of
infamy, used to come very modestly clothed; but the
Anemolians, lying more remote, and having had little
commerce with them, understanding that they were
coarsely clothed, and all in the same manner, took it for
granted that they had none of those fine things among
them of which they made no use; and they, being a
vainglorious rather than a wise people, resolved to set themselves out with so much pomp that they should look
like gods, and strike the eyes of the poor Utopians with
their splendour. Thus three ambassadors made their entry
with a hundred attendants, all clad in garments of different
colours, and the greater part in silk; the ambassadors
themselves, who were of the nobility of their country,
were in cloth-of-gold, and adorned with massy chains,
earrings and rings of gold; their caps were covered with
bracelets set full of pearls and other gems—in a word, they
were set out with all those things that among the Utopians
were either the badges of slavery, the marks of infamy, or
the playthings of children. It was not unpleasant to see, on
the one side, how they looked big, when they compared
their rich habits with the plain clothes of the Utopians,
who were come out in great numbers to see them make
their entry; and, on the other, to observe how much they
were mistaken in the impression which they hoped this
pomp would have made on them. It appeared so
ridiculous a show to all that had never stirred out of their
country, and had not seen the customs of other nations,
that though they paid some reverence to those that were
the most meanly clad, as if they had been the ambassadors,
yet when they saw the ambassadors themselves so full of
gold and chains, they looked upon them as slaves, andforbore to treat them with reverence. You might have
seen the children who were grown big enough to despise
their playthings, and who had thrown away their jewels,
call to their mothers, push them gently, and cry out, ‘See
that great fool, that wears pearls and gems as if he were yet
a child!’ while their mothers very innocently replied,
‘Hold your peace! this, I believe, is one of the
ambassadors’ fools.’ Others censured the fashion of their
chains, and observed, ‘That they were of no use, for they
were too slight to bind their slaves, who could easily break
them; and, besides, hung so loose about them that they
thought it easy to throw their away, and so get from
them.’ But after the ambassadors had stayed a day among
them, and saw so vast a quantity of gold in their houses
(which was as much despised by them as it was esteemed
in other nations), and beheld more gold and silver in the
chains and fetters of one slave than all their ornaments
amounted to, their plumes fell, and they were ashamed of
all that glory for which they had formed valued
themselves, and accordingly laid it aside—a resolution that
they immediately took when, on their engaging in some
free discourse with the Utopians, they discovered their
sense of such things and their other customs. The
Utopians wonder how any man should be so much taken with the glaring doubtful lustre of a jewel or a stone, that
can look up to a star or to the sun himself; or how any
should value himself because his cloth is made of a finer
thread; for, how fine soever that thread may be, it was
once no better than the fleece of a sheep, and that sheep,
was a sheep still, for all its wearing it. They wonder much
to hear that gold, which in itself is so useless a thing,
should be everywhere so much esteemed that even man,
for whom it was made, and by whom it has its value,
should yet be thought of less value than this metal; that a
man of lead, who has no more sense than a log of wood,
and is as bad as he is foolish, should have many wise and
good men to serve him, only because he has a great heap
of that metal; and that if it should happen that by some
accident or trick of law (which, sometimes produces as
great changes as chance itself) all this wealth should pass
from the master to the meanest varlet of his whole family,
he himself would very soon become one of his servants, as
if he were a thing that belonged to his wealth, and so were
bound to follow its fortune! But they much more admire
and detest the folly of those who, when they see a rich
man, though they neither owe him anything, nor are in
any sort dependent on his bounty, yet, merely because he
is rich, give him little less than divine honours, even though they know him to be so covetous and baseminded
that, notwithstanding all his wealth, he will not
part with one farthing of it to them as long as he lives!
