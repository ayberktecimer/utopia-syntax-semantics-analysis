‘There are several sorts of religions, not only in
different parts of the island, but even in every town; some
worshipping the sun, others the moon or one of the
planets. Some worship such men as have been eminent in
former times for virtue or glory, not only as ordinary
deities, but as the supreme god. Yet the greater and wiser
sort of them worship none of these, but adore one eternal,
invisible, infinite, and incomprehensible Deity; as a Being
that is far above all our apprehensions, that is spread over
the whole universe, not by His bulk, but by His power
and virtue; Him they call the Father of All, and
acknowledge that the beginnings, the increase, the
progress, the vicissitudes, and the end of all things come
only from Him; nor do they offer divine honours to any
but to Him alone. And, indeed, though they differ
concerning other things, yet all agree in this: that they
think there is one Supreme Being that made and governs
the world, whom they call, in the language of their
country, Mithras. They differ in this: that one thinks the
god whom he worships is this Supreme Being, and
another thinks that his idol is that god; but they all agreein one principle, that whoever is this Supreme Being, He
is also that great essence to whose glory and majesty all
honours are ascribed by the consent of all nations.
‘By degrees they fall off from the various superstitions
that are among them, and grow up to that one religion
that is the best and most in request; and there is no doubt
to be made, but that all the others had vanished long ago,
if some of those who advised them to lay aside their
superstitions had not met with some unhappy accidents,
which, being considered as inflicted by heaven, made
them afraid that the god whose worship had like to have
been abandoned had interposed and revenged themselves
on those who despised their authority.
‘After they had heard from us an account of the
doctrine, the course of life, and the miracles of Christ, and
of the wonderful constancy of so many martyrs, whose
blood, so willingly offered up by them, was the chief
occasion of spreading their religion over a vast number of
nations, it is not to be imagined how inclined they were to
receive it. I shall not determine whether this proceeded
from any secret inspiration of God, or whether it was
because it seemed so favourable to that community of
goods, which is an opinion so particular as well as so dear
to them; since they perceived that Christ and Hisfollowers lived by that rule, and that it was still kept up in
some communities among the sincerest sort of Christians.
From whichsoever of these motives it might be, true it is,
that many of them came over to our religion, and were
initiated into it by baptism. But as two of our number
were dead, so none of the four that survived were in
priests’ orders, we, therefore, could only baptise them, so
that, to our great regret, they could not partake of the
other sacraments, that can only be administered by priests,
but they are instructed concerning them and long most
vehemently for them. They have had great disputes among
themselves, whether one chosen by them to be a priest
would not be thereby qualified to do all the things that
belong to that character, even though he had no authority
derived from the Pope, and they seemed to be resolved to
choose some for that employment, but they had not done
it when I left them.
‘Those among them that have not received our religion
do not fright any from it, and use none ill that goes over
to it, so that all the while I was there one man was only
punished on this occasion. He being newly baptised did,
notwithstanding all that we could say to the contrary,
dispute publicly concerning the Christian religion, with
more zeal than discretion, and with so much heat, that henot only preferred our worship to theirs, but condemned
all their rites as profane, and cried out against all that
adhered to them as impious and sacrilegious persons, that
were to be damned to everlasting burnings. Upon his
having frequently preached in this manner he was seized,
and after trial he was condemned to banishment, not for
having disparaged their religion, but for his inflaming the
people to sedition; for this is one of their most ancient
laws, that no man ought to be punished for his religion. At
the first constitution of their government, Utopus having
understood that before his coming among them the old
inhabitants had been engaged in great quarrels concerning
religion, by which they were so divided among
themselves, that he found it an easy thing to conquer
them, since, instead of uniting their forces against him,
every different party in religion fought by themselves.
After he had subdued them he made a law that every man
might be of what religion he pleased, and might
endeavour to draw others to it by the force of argument
and by amicable and modest ways, but without bitterness
against those of other opinions; but that he ought to use
no other force but that of persuasion, and was neither to
mix with it reproaches nor violence; and such as did otherwise were to be condemned to banishment or
slavery.
‘This law was made by Utopus, not only for preserving
the public peace, which he saw suffered much by daily
contentions and irreconcilable heats, but because he
thought the interest of religion itself required it. He
judged it not fit to determine anything rashly; and seemed
to doubt whether those different forms of religion might
not all come from God, who might inspire man in a
different manner, and be pleased with this variety; he
therefore thought it indecent and foolish for any man to
threaten and terrify another to make him believe what did
not appear to him to be true. And supposing that only one
religion was really true, and the rest false, he imagined that
the native force of truth would at last break forth and
shine bright, if supported only by the strength of
argument, and attended to with a gentle and unprejudiced
mind; while, on the other hand, if such debates were
carried on with violence and tumults, as the most wicked
are always the most obstinate, so the best and most holy
religion might be choked with superstition, as corn is with
briars and thorns; he therefore left men wholly to their
liberty, that they might be free to believe as they should
see cause; only he made a solemn and severe law against such as should so far degenerate from the dignity of
human nature, as to think that our souls died with our
bodies, or that the world was governed by chance,
without a wise overruling Providence: for they all
formerly believed that there was a state of rewards and
punishments to the good and bad after this life; and they
now look on those that think otherwise as scarce fit to be
counted men, since they degrade so noble a being as the
soul, and reckon it no better than a beast’s: thus they are
far from looking on such men as fit for human society, or
to be citizens of a well-ordered commonwealth; since a
man of such principles must needs, as oft as he dares do it,
despise all their laws and customs: for there is no doubt to
be made, that a man who is afraid of nothing but the law,
and apprehends nothing after death, will not scruple to
break through all the laws of his country, either by fraud
or force, when by this means he may satisfy his appetites.
They never raise any that hold these maxims, either to
honours or offices, nor employ them in any public trust,
but despise them, as men of base and sordid minds. Yet
they do not punish them, because they lay this down as a
maxim, that a man cannot make himself believe anything
he pleases; nor do they drive any to dissemble their
thoughts by threatenings, so that men are not tempted to lie or disguise their opinions; which being a sort of fraud,
is abhorred by the Utopians: they take care indeed to
prevent their disputing in defence of these opinions,
especially before the common people: but they suffer, and
even encourage them to dispute concerning them in
private with their priest, and other grave men, being
confident that they will be cured of those mad opinions by
having reason laid before them. There are many among
them that run far to the other extreme, though it is neither
thought an ill nor unreasonable opinion, and therefore is
not at all discouraged. They think that the souls of beasts
are immortal, though far inferior to the dignity of the
human soul, and not capable of so great a happiness. They
are almost all of them very firmly persuaded that good
men will be infinitely happy in another state: so that
though they are compassionate to all that are sick, yet they
lament no man’s death, except they see him loath to part
with life; for they look on this as a very ill presage, as if the
soul, conscious to itself of guilt, and quite hopeless, was
afraid to leave the body, from some secret hints of
approaching misery. They think that such a man’s
appearance before God cannot be acceptable to Him, who
being called on, does not go out cheerfully, but is
backward and unwilling, and is as it were dragged to it. They are struck with horror when they see any die in this
manner, and carry them out in silence and with sorrow,
and praying God that He would be merciful to the errors
of the departed soul, they lay the body in the ground: but
when any die cheerfully, and full of hope, they do not
mourn for them, but sing hymns when they carry out
their bodies, and commending their souls very earnestly to
God: their whole behaviour is then rather grave than sad,
they burn the body, and set up a pillar where the pile was
made, with an inscription to the honour of the deceased.
When they come from the funeral, they discourse of his
good life, and worthy actions, but speak of nothing
oftener and with more pleasure than of his serenity at the
hour of death. They think such respect paid to the
memory of good men is both the greatest incitement to
engage others to follow their example, and the most
acceptable worship that can be offered them; for they
believe that though by the imperfection of human sight
they are invisible to us, yet they are present among us, and
hear those discourses that pass concerning themselves.
They believe it inconsistent with the happiness of departed
souls not to be at liberty to be where they will: and do not
imagine them capable of the ingratitude of not desiring to
see those friends with whom they lived on earth in the strictest bonds of love and kindness: besides, they are
persuaded that good men, after death, have these
affections; and all other good dispositions increased rather
than diminished, and therefore conclude that they are still
among the living, and observe all they say or do. From
hence they engage in all their affairs with the greater
confidence of success, as trusting to their protection; while
this opinion of the presence of their ancestors is a restraint
that prevents their engaging in ill designs.
‘They despise and laugh at auguries, and the other vain
and superstitious ways of divination, so much observed
among other nations; but have great reverence for such
miracles as cannot flow from any of the powers of nature,
and look on them as effects and indications of the presence
of the Supreme Being, of which they say many instances
have occurred among them; and that sometimes their
public prayers, which upon great and dangerous occasions
they have solemnly put up to God, with assured
confidence of being heard, have been answered in a
miraculous manner.
‘They think the contemplating God in His works, and
the adoring Him for them, is a very acceptable piece of
worship to Him. ‘There are many among them that upon a motive of
religion neglect learning, and apply themselves to no sort
of study; nor do they allow themselves any leisure time,
but are perpetually employed, believing that by the good
things that a man does he secures to himself that happiness
that comes after death. Some of these visit the sick; others
mend highways, cleanse ditches, repair bridges, or dig turf,
gravel, or stone. Others fell and cleave timber, and bring
wood, corn, and other necessaries, on carts, into their
towns; nor do these only serve the public, but they serve
even private men, more than the slaves themselves do: for
if there is anywhere a rough, hard, and sordid piece of
work to be done, from which many are frightened by the
labour and loathsomeness of it, if not the despair of
accomplishing it, they cheerfully, and of their own accord,
take that to their share; and by that means, as they ease
others very much, so they afflict themselves, and spend
their whole life in hard labour: and yet they do not value
themselves upon this, nor lessen other people’s credit to
raise their own; but by their stooping to such servile
employments they are so far from being despised, that they
are so much the more esteemed by the whole nation.
‘Of these there are two sorts: some live unmarried and
chaste, and abstain from eating any sort of flesh; and thusweaning themselves from all the pleasures of the present
life, which they account hurtful, they pursue, even by the
hardest and painfullest methods possible, that blessedness
which they hope for hereafter; and the nearer they
approach to it, they are the more cheerful and earnest in
their endeavours after it. Another sort of them is less
willing to put themselves to much toil, and therefore
prefer a married state to a single one; and as they do not
deny themselves the pleasure of it, so they think the
begetting of children is a debt which they owe to human
nature, and to their country; nor do they avoid any
pleasure that does not hinder labour; and therefore eat
flesh so much the more willingly, as they find that by this
means they are the more able to work: the Utopians look
upon these as the wiser sect, but they esteem the others as
the most holy. They would indeed laugh at any man who,
from the principles of reason, would prefer an unmarried
state to a married, or a life of labour to an easy life: but
they reverence and admire such as do it from the motives
of religion. There is nothing in which they are more
cautious than in giving their opinion positively concerning
any sort of religion. The men that lead those severe lives
are called in the language of their country Brutheskas,
which answers to those we call Religious Orders. ‘Their priests are men of eminent piety, and therefore
they are but few, for there are only thirteen in every town,
one for every temple; but when they go to war, seven of
these go out with their forces, and seven others are chosen
to supply their room in their absence; but these enter
again upon their employments when they return; and
those who served in their absence, attend upon the high
priest, till vacancies fall by death; for there is one set over
the rest. They are chosen by the people as the other
magistrates are, by suffrages given in secret, for preventing
of factions: and when they are chosen, they are
consecrated by the college of priests. The care of all sacred
things, the worship of God, and an inspection into the
manners of the people, are committed to them. It is a
reproach to a man to be sent for by any of them, or for
them to speak to him in secret, for that always gives some
suspicion: all that is incumbent on them is only to exhort
and admonish the people; for the power of correcting and
punishing ill men belongs wholly to the Prince, and to the
other magistrates: the severest thing that the priest does is
the excluding those that are desperately wicked from
joining in their worship: there is not any sort of
punishment more dreaded by them than this, for as it loads
them with infamy, so it fills them with secret horrors, such is their reverence to their religion; nor will their bodies be
long exempted from their share of trouble; for if they do
not very quickly satisfy the priests of the truth of their
repentance, they are seized on by the Senate, and punished
for their impiety. The education of youth belongs to the
priests, yet they do not take so much care of instructing
them in letters, as in forming their minds and manners
aright; they use all possible methods to infuse, very early,
into the tender and flexible minds of children, such
opinions as are both good in themselves and will be useful
to their country, for when deep impressions of these
things are made at that age, they follow men through the
whole course of their lives, and conduce much to preserve
the peace of the government, which suffers by nothing
more than by vices that rise out of ill opinions. The wives
of their priests are the most extraordinary women of the
whole country; sometimes the women themselves are
made priests, though that falls out but seldom, nor are any
but ancient widows chosen into that order.
‘None of the magistrates have greater honour paid
them than is paid the priests; and if they should happen to
commit any crime, they would not be questioned for it;
their punishment is left to God, and to their own
consciences; for they do not think it lawful to lay hands onany man, how wicked soever he is, that has been in a
peculiar manner dedicated to God; nor do they find any
great inconvenience in this, both because they have so few
priests, and because these are chosen with much caution,
so that it must be a very unusual thing to find one who,
merely out of regard to his virtue, and for his being
esteemed a singularly good man, was raised up to so great
a dignity, degenerate into corruption and vice; and if such
a thing should fall out, for man is a changeable creature,
yet, there being few priests, and these having no authority
but what rises out of the respect that is paid them, nothing
of great consequence to the public can proceed from the
indemnity that the priests enjoy.
‘They have, indeed, very few of them, lest greater
numbers sharing in the same honour might make the
dignity of that order, which they esteem so highly, to sink
in its reputation; they also think it difficult to find out
many of such an exalted pitch of goodness as to be equal
to that dignity, which demands the exercise of more than
ordinary virtues. Nor are the priests in greater veneration
among them than they are among their neighbouring
nations, as you may imagine by that which I think gives
occasion for it. ‘When the Utopians engage in battle, the priests who
accompany them to the war, apparelled in their sacred
vestments, kneel down during the action (in a place not
far from the field), and, lifting up their hands to heaven,
pray, first for peace, and then for victory to their own side,
and particularly that it may be gained without the effusion
of much blood on either side; and when the victory turns
to their side, they run in among their own men to restrain
their fury; and if any of their enemies see them or call to
them, they are preserved by that means; and such as can
come so near them as to touch their garments have not
only their lives, but their fortunes secured to them; it is
upon this account that all the nations round about
consider them so much, and treat them with such
reverence, that they have been often no less able to
preserve their own people from the fury of their enemies
than to save their enemies from their rage; for it has
sometimes fallen out, that when their armies have been in
disorder and forced to fly, so that their enemies were
running upon the slaughter and spoil, the priests by
interposing have separated them from one another, and
stopped the effusion of more blood; so that, by their
mediation, a peace has been concluded on very reasonable
terms; nor is there any nation about them so fierce, cruel, or barbarous, as not to look upon their persons as sacred
and inviolable.
‘The first and the last day of the month, and of the
year, is a festival; they measure their months by the course
of the moon, and their years by the course of the sun: the
first days are called in their language the Cynemernes, and
the last the Trapemernes, which answers in our language,
to the festival that begins or ends the season.
‘They have magnificent temples, that are not only
nobly built, but extremely spacious, which is the more
necessary as they have so few of them; they are a little dark
within, which proceeds not from any error in the
architecture, but is done with design; for their priests think
that too much light dissipates the thoughts, and that a
more moderate degree of it both recollects the mind and
raises devotion. Though there are many different forms of
religion among them, yet all these, how various soever,
agree in the main point, which is the worshipping the
Divine Essence; and, therefore, there is nothing to be seen
or heard in their temples in which the several persuasions
among them may not agree; for every sect performs those
rites that are peculiar to it in their private houses, nor is
there anything in the public worship that contradicts the
particular ways of those different sects. There are no images for God in their temples, so that every one may represent Him to his thoughts according to the way of his religion; nor do they call this one God by any other name but that of Mithras, which is the common name by which they all express the Divine Essence, whatsoever otherwise they think it to be; nor are there any prayers among them but such as every one of them may use without prejudice to his own opinion.
‘They meet in their temples on the evening of the festival that concludes a season, and not having yet broke their fast, they thank God for their good success during that year or month which is then at an end; and the next day, being that which begins the new season, they meet early in their temples, to pray for the happy progress of all their affairs during that period upon which they then  enter. In the festival which concludes the period, before they go to the temple, both wives and children fall on  their knees before their husbands or parents and confess everything in which they have either erred or failed in their duty, and beg pardon for it. Thus all little discontents in families are removed, that they may offer up their devotions with a pure and serene mind; for they hold it a great impiety to enter upon them with disturbed thoughts, or with a consciousness of their bearing hatred or anger in
 

their hearts to any person whatsoever; and think that they should become liable to severe punishments if they presumed to offer sacrifices without cleansing their hearts, and reconciling all their differences. In the temples the two sexes are separated, the men go to the right hand, and the women to the left; and the males and females all place themselves before the head and master or mistress of the family to which they belong, so that those who have the government of them at home may see their deportment in public. And they intermingle them so, that the younger and the older may be set by one another; for if the younger sort were all set together, they would, perhaps, trifle away that time too much in which they ought to beget in themselves that religious dread of the Supreme Being which is the greatest and almost the only incitement to virtue.
‘They offer up no living creature in sacrifice, nor do they think it suitable to the Divine Being, from whose bounty it is that these creatures have derived their lives, to take pleasure in their deaths, or the offering up their blood. They burn incense and other sweet odours, and have a great number of wax lights during their worship, not out of any imagination that such oblations can add anything to the divine nature (which even prayers cannot
 
do), but as it is a harmless and pure way of worshipping God; so they think those sweet savours and lights, together with some other ceremonies, by a secret and unaccountable virtue, elevate men’s souls, and inflame them with greater energy and cheerfulness during the divine worship.
‘All the people appear in the temples in white garments; but the priest’s vestments are parti-coloured, and both the work and colours are wonderful. They are made of no rich materials, for they are neither embroidered nor set with precious stones; but are composed of the plumes of several birds, laid together with so much art, and so neatly, that the true value of them is far beyond the costliest materials. They say, that in the ordering and placing those plumes some dark mysteries are represented, which pass down among their priests in a secret tradition concerning them; and that they are as hieroglyphics, putting them in mind of the blessing that they have received from God, and of their duties, both to Him and  to their neighbours. As soon as the priest appears in those ornaments, they all fall prostrate on the ground, with so much reverence and so deep a silence, that such as look on cannot but be struck with it, as if it were the effect of the appearance of a deity. After they have been for some time
 

in this posture, they all stand up, upon a sign given by the priest, and sing hymns to the honour of God, some  musical instruments playing all the while. These are quite of another form than those used among us; but, as many of them are much sweeter than ours, so others are made use of by us. Yet in one thing they very much exceed us: all their music, both vocal and instrumental, is adapted to imitate and express the passions, and is so happily suited to every occasion, that, whether the subject of the hymn be cheerful, or formed to soothe or trouble the mind, or to express grief or remorse, the music takes the impression of whatever is represented, affects and kindles the passions, and works the sentiments deep into the hearts of the hearers. When this is done, both priests and people offer up very solemn prayers to God in a set form of words; and these are so composed, that whatsoever is pronounced by the whole assembly may be likewise applied by every man in particular to his own condition. In these they acknowledge God to be the author and governor of the world, and the fountain of all the good they receive, and therefore offer up to him their thanksgiving; and, in particular, bless him for His goodness in ordering it so, that they are born under the happiest government in the world, and are of a religion which they hope is the truest
 
of all others; but, if they are mistaken, and if there is either a better government, or a religion more acceptable  to God, they implore His goodness to let them know it, vowing that they resolve to follow him whithersoever he leads them; but if their government is the best, and their religion the truest, then they pray that He may fortify them in it, and bring all the world both to the same rules of life, and to the same opinions concerning Himself, unless, according to the unsearchableness of His mind, He is pleased with a variety of religions. Then they pray that God may give them an easy passage at last to Himself, not presuming to set limits to Him, how early or late it should be; but, if it may be wished for without derogating from His supreme authority, they desire to be quickly delivered, and to be taken to Himself, though by the most terrible kind of death, rather than to be detained long from seeing Him by the most prosperous course of life. When this prayer is ended, they all fall down again upon the ground; and, after a little while, they rise up, go home to dinner, and spend the rest of the day in diversion or military exercises.
