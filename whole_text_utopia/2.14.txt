‘Some of their neighbours, who are masters of their
own liberties (having long ago, by the assistance of the
Utopians, shaken off the yoke of tyranny, and being much
taken with those virtues which they observe among them),
have come to desire that they would send magistrates to
govern them, some changing them every year, and others
every five years; at the end of their government they bring
them back to Utopia, with great expressions of honour
and esteem, and carry away others to govern in their stead.
In this they seem to have fallen upon a very good
expedient for their own happiness and safety; for since the
good or ill condition of a nation depends so much upon
their magistrates, they could not have made a better choice
than by pitching on men whom no advantages can bias;
for wealth is of no use to them, since they must so soon go back to their own country, and they, being strangers
among them, are not engaged in any of their heats or
animosities; and it is certain that when public judicatories
are swayed, either by avarice or partial affections, there
must follow a dissolution of justice, the chief sinew of
society.
‘The Utopians call those nations that come and ask
magistrates from them Neighbours; but those to whom
they have been of more particular service, Friends; and as
all other nations are perpetually either making leagues or
breaking them, they never enter into an alliance with any
state. They think leagues are useless things, and believe
that if the common ties of humanity do not knit men
together, the faith of promises will have no great effect;
and they are the more confirmed in this by what they see
among the nations round about them, who are no strict
observers of leagues and treaties. We know how
religiously they are observed in Europe, more particularly
where the Christian doctrine is received, among whom
they are sacred and inviolable! which is partly owing to
the justice and goodness of the princes themselves, and
partly to the reverence they pay to the popes, who, as they
are the most religious observers of their own promises, so
they exhort all other princes to perform theirs, and, when fainter methods do not prevail, they compel them to it by
the severity of the pastoral censure, and think that it would
be the most indecent thing possible if men who are
particularly distinguished by the title of ‘The Faithful’
should not religiously keep the faith of their treaties. But
in that new-found world, which is not more distant from
us in situation than the people are in their manners and
course of life, there is no trusting to leagues, even though
they were made with all the pomp of the most sacred
ceremonies; on the contrary, they are on this account the
sooner broken, some slight pretence being found in the
words of the treaties, which are purposely couched in such
ambiguous terms that they can never be so strictly bound
but they will always find some loophole to escape at, and
thus they break both their leagues and their faith; and this
is done with such impudence, that those very men who
value themselves on having suggested these expedients to
their princes would, with a haughty scorn, declaim against
such craft; or, to speak plainer, such fraud and deceit, if
they found private men make use of it in their bargains,
and would readily say that they deserved to be hanged.
‘By this means it is that all sort of justice passes in the
world for a low-spirited and vulgar virtue, far below the
dignity of royal greatness—or at least there are set up two sorts of justice; the one is mean and creeps on the ground,
and, therefore, becomes none but the lower part of
mankind, and so must be kept in severely by many
restraints, that it may not break out beyond the bounds
that are set to it; the other is the peculiar virtue of princes,
which, as it is more majestic than that which becomes the
rabble, so takes a freer compass, and thus lawful and
unlawful are only measured by pleasure and interest. These
practices of the princes that lie about Utopia, who make so
little account of their faith, seem to be the reasons that
determine them to engage in no confederacy. Perhaps
they would change their mind if they lived among us; but
yet, though treaties were more religiously observed, they
would still dislike the custom of making them, since the
world has taken up a false maxim upon it, as if there were
no tie of nature uniting one nation to another, only
separated perhaps by a mountain or a river, and that all
were born in a state of hostility, and so might lawfully do
all that mischief to their neighbours against which there is
no provision made by treaties; and that when treaties are
made they do not cut off the enmity or restrain the licence
of preying upon each other, if, by the unskilfulness of
wording them, there are not effectual provisoes made
against them; they, on the other hand, judge that no man is to be esteemed our enemy that has never injured us, and
that the partnership of human nature is instead of a league;
and that kindness and good nature unite men more
effectually and with greater strength than any agreements
whatsoever, since thereby the engagements of men’s hearts
become stronger than the bond and obligation of words.
