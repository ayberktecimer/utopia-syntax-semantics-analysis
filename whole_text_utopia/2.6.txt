If any man has a mind to visit his friends that live in
some other town, or desires to travel and see the rest of
the country, he obtains leave very easily from the
Syphogrant and Tranibors, when there is no particular
occasion for him at home. Such as travel carry with them a
passport from the Prince, which both certifies the licence
that is granted for travelling, and limits the time of their
return. They are furnished with a waggon and a slave,
who drives the oxen and looks after them; but, unless
there are women in the company, the waggon is sent back
at the end of the journey as a needless encumbrance.
While they are on the road they carry no provisions with
them, yet they want for nothing, but are everywhere
treated as if they were at home. If they stay in any place
longer than a night, every one follows his proper
occupation, and is very well used by those of his own
trade; but if any man goes out of the city to which he
belongs without leave, and is found rambling without a
passport, he is severely treated, he is punished as a fugitive,
and sent home disgracefully; and, if he falls again into the like fault, is condemned to slavery. If any man has a mind
to travel only over the precinct of his own city, he may
freely do it, with his father’s permission and his wife’s
consent; but when he comes into any of the country
houses, if he expects to be entertained by them, he must
labour with them and conform to their rules; and if he
does this, he may freely go over the whole precinct, being
then as useful to the city to which he belongs as if he were
still within it. Thus you see that there are no idle persons
among them, nor pretences of excusing any from labour.
There are no taverns, no alehouses, nor stews among
them, nor any other occasions of corrupting each other, of
getting into corners, or forming themselves into parties; all
men live in full view, so that all are obliged both to
perform their ordinary task and to employ themselves well
in their spare hours; and it is certain that a people thus
ordered must live in great abundance of all things, and
these being equally distributed among them, no man can
want or be obliged to beg.
‘In their great council at Amaurot, to which there are
three sent from every town once a year, they examine
what towns abound in provisions and what are under any
scarcity, that so the one may be furnished from the other;
and this is done freely, without any sort of exchange; for, according to their plenty or scarcity, they supply or are
supplied from one another, so that indeed the whole island
is, as it were, one family.
